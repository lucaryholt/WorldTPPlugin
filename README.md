# WorldTPPlugin
A simple Minecraft plugin for Bukkit based servers.

Enables a command, that opens a GUI, where players can choose from different locations to teleport to.


The locations are stored in a **MySQL** database.

OPs can add locations from within Minecraft, but they can also be added directly in the database.

## Further development
- Personal locations
- Easier adding
- Editing locations in game
